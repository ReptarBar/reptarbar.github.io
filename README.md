# Commit Confidential – Secret Shopper Instructions

## Mission Brief

Welcome, Agent.

Your task is to enter an open source community as a **first-time contributor** and record your experience.  
You’ll observe how it feels to join, communicate, and contribute, then submit a structured report to help us understand what real contributor journeys look like.

The goal is to highlight **patterns**, not people.  
We measure **accessibility, culture, and transparency**, so communities can grow healthier and more welcoming.

- **Target:** One open source community or project (GitHub, GitLab, forum, chat, etc.)  
- **Duration:** About 60–90 minutes total (plus 30 minutes for the report)  
- **Engagement Type:** Ask a question, try to contribute something simple, or reproduce a documented example.  
- **Deliverable:** One completed evaluation report (see provided template).
