# reptarbar.github.io

Minimal identity homepage for **ReptarBar** with a hub for **ThunderBard Labs**.

## Quick start

1. Create a new repo named `reptarbar.github.io` in your GitHub account.
2. Upload these files to the root of the repo.
3. Commit to `main`. GitHub Pages will auto serve the site at https://reptarbar.github.io/

### Optional: custom domain

- Add a `CNAME` file at the repo root that contains only your domain, for example:
```
labs.reptarbar.com
```
- Point your DNS `CNAME` record for `labs.reptarbar.com` to `reptarbar.github.io`.

## Sections you can edit

- **Experiments** links in `index.html` to point at your real repos.
- **Crew** list to reflect your current collaborators or personas.
- **assets/labs-hero.png** can be replaced with your own PNG.

## Accessibility notes

- High contrast colors and large targets.
- Landmarks and headings for screen readers.
- No motion and no audio by default.
